# Get Started with Microsoft Azure IoT Starter Kit - Intel Edison

This page contains technical information to help you get familiar with Azure IoT using the Azure IoT Starter Kit - Intel Edison. You will find two tutorials that will walk you through different scenarios. The first tutorial will show you how to connect your Azure IoT Starter kit to our Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution from Azure IoT Suite. In the second tutorial, you will leverage Azure IoT services to create your own IoT solution.

You can choose to start with whichever tutorial you want to. If you've never worked with Azure IoT services before, we encourage you to start with the Remote Monitoring solution tutorial, because all of the Azure services will be provisioned for you in a built-in preconfigured solution. Then you can explore how each of the services work by going through the second tutorial.

We hope you enjoy the tutorials! Please provide feedback if there's anything that we can improve.

## 1.1 Tutorial Overview

In this tutorial, you'll be doing the following:

- Setting up your environment on Azure using the Microsoft Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring preconfigured solution, getting a large portion of the set-up that would be required done in one step.
- Setting your device and sensors up so that it can communicate with both your computer, and Azure IoT. 
- Updating the device code sample to include our connection data and send it to Azure to be viewed remotely.

<a name="section1.2" />
## 1.2 Before Starting

<a name="section1.2.1" />
### 1.2.1 Required Software

- Intel Edison drivers, available here: 
  - [Windows users](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-edison-windows)
  - [Mac users](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-edison-osx)
  - [Linux users](https://software.intel.com/en-us/get-started-edison-linux)
   
<a name="section1.2.2" />
### 1.2.2 Required Hardware

- Intel Edison Grove kit
  - Two USB Mini cables 
  
<a name="section1.3" />
## 1.3 Create a New Azure IoT Suite Remote Monitoring solution and Add Device

- Log in to [Azure IoT Suite](https://www.azureiotsuite.com/)  with your Microsoft account and click **Create a New Preconfigured Solution** 

***
**Note:** For first time users, click here to get your [Azure free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) which gives you 200USD of credit to get started.
***

- Click select in the **Remote Monitoring** option
- Type in a solution name. For this tutorial we’ll be using _“EdisonSuite”_ (You will have to name it something else. Make it unique. I.E. "ContosoSample")

***
**Note:** Make sure to copy down the names and connection strings mentioned into a text document for reference later.
***

- Choose your subscription plan and geographic region, then click **Create Solution**
- Wait for Azure to finish provisioning your IoT suite (this process may take up to 10 minutes), and then click **Launch**

***
**Note:** You may be asked to log back in. This is to ensure your solution has proper permissions associated with your account. 
***

- Open the link to your IoT Suite’s “Solution Dashboard.” You may have been redirected there already. 
- This opens your personal remote monitoring site at the URL _&lt;Your Azure IoT Hub suite name&gt;.azurewebsites.net_ (e.g. _EdisonSuite.azurewebsites.net_)
- Click **Add a Device** at the lower left hand corner of your screen
- Add a new **custom device**
- Enter your desired `device ID`. In this case we’ll use _“Edison_Grove”_, and then click Check ID
- If Device ID is available, go ahead and click **Create**
- Make note of your `device ID`, `Device Key`, and `IoT Hub Hostname` to enter into the code you’ll run on your device later 

***
**Warning:** The Remote Monitoring solution provisions a set of Azure IoT Services in your Azure account. It is meant to reflect a real enterprise architecture and thus its Azure consumption is quite heavy. To avoid unnecessary Azure consumption, we recommend you delete the preconfigured solution in azureiotsuite.com once you are done with your work (since it is easy to recreate). Alternatively, if you want to keep it up and running you can do several things to reduce consumption:

1) Visit this [guide](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-remote-monitoring/blob/master/Docs/configure-preconfigured-demo.md) to run the solution in demo mode and reduce the Azure consumption.  

2) Disable the simulated devices created with the solution (Go to Devices>>Select the device>> on the device details menu on the right, clich on Disable Device. Repeat with all the simulated devices).

3) **Stop** your remote monitoring solution while you are working on the next steps. (See: [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting))

 <a name="section1.4" />
## 1.4 Prepare your device

If this is the first time you use your Intel Edison board, you will have to follow some steps to assemble it.

- Please follow steps 1-4 of the [instructions](https://software.intel.com/en-us/iot/library/edison-getting-started). Intel's IDE (Step 5) is optional for our tutorial.
- Flash your board with the latest [firmware](https://www-ssl.intel.com/content/www/us/en/support/boards-and-kits/000005990.html)

<a name="section1.5" />
## 1.5 Connect the Grove Sensor Module to your Device

- Begin by placing the Base Shield over the pins on your Intel Edison board
- Using [this image](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-node-intel-edison-getstartedkit/blob/master/img/edison_remote_monitoring.png?raw=true) as a reference, connect your Grove sensor and the Intel Edison
- For sensor pins, we will use the following wiring:

| Edison Port   | Component    | 
| ------------- | ------------ | 
| A0            | Temperature  | 

- For more information, see: [Seeed studio's wiki](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Base_shield_v2).

**At the end of your work, your Intel Edison should be connected with a working sensor. We'll test it in the next sections.**

<a name="section1.6" />
## 1.6 Modify, build and run the Remote Monitoring sample 

- In your Edison boards command line, type the following command to transfer the files to your board:

```  
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-node-intel-edison-getstartedkit/master/remote_monitoring/remote_monitoring.js
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-hub-node-intel-edison-getstartedkit/master/remote_monitoring/package.json
```  

- Open the file **remote_monitoring.js** in a text editor using the command:

```
nano remote_monitoring.js
```

- Nano is generally not installed with Yocto build. If you don't have it installed already, here are the instructions to install nano on your intel edision:

```
mkdir nano-installer
cd nano-installer
wget http://www.nano-editor.org/dist/v2.2/nano-2.2.6.tar.gz 
tar xvf nano-2.2.6.tar.gz 
cd nano-2.2.6 
./configure && make && make install

```

- Locate the following code in the file and update your connection data:

```
var hostName = '<IOTHUB_HOST_NAME>';
var deviceId = '<DEVICE_ID>';
var sharedAccessKey = '<SHARED_ACCESS_KEY>';
```

- Save your changes by pressing Ctrl+O and when nano prompts you to save it as the same file, just press ENTER.

- Press Ctrl+X to exit nano.

- Run the sample application using the following commands:

```
npm install
node remote_monitoring.js
```

<a name="section1.7" />
## 1.7 View the Sensor Data from the Remote Monitoring Portal

- Once you have the sample running, visit your dashboard by visiting azureiotsuite.com and clicking “Launch” on your solution
- Make sure the “Device to View” in the upper right is set to your device
- If the demo is running, ou should see an output on your command window that shows your device details and the sensor data. Also, check out how the graph changes in real time as your data updates!

***
**Note:** Make sure you delete or  **stop** your remote monitoring solution once you have completed this to avoid unnecesary Azure consumption! Check out the troubleshooting section for more details.
